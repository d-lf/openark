### Code for Steve

Only reactive, when you are tagged in a vtxo_spend_request you subscribe to the thread. You check if the current thread has enough information to complete the transaction. IE, you go over all of the inputs that are beeing spent and check:
1. Verify that the input is open for spending.
2. Check that all the signatures and other attributes are there.

If so, then you complete it, this means mark all the inputs as spent. Then send out the complete message and then unsubscribe from the thread.

If a recall request is received, mark the request as recalled. Issue a vtxo_spend_recalled, and unsubscribe from the thread.
